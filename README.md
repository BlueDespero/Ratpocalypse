# Ratpocalypse
Small, Plants vs. Zombies inspired game written in Java. Final assignment for the 2019/2020 Object Oriented Programming class. 

The easiest way to run the game yourself is executing the .jar file in the main directory of the repository. It requires OpenJDK 17 to run.

The goal is to survive the waves of rats trying to devastate the garden. If the rats reach the left side of the sreen they start killing the Yellow Roses, which play the role of your currency and HP.

# TODO
Localization - Currently the options are in Polish. I will make the default to be English and put an option to change the language in the settings menu.
